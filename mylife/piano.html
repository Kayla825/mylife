	<p>I've been playing piano for 11 years and I enjoy it very much. Despite my interests in music (which you may or may not have seen before this) I usually play classical music on the piano. My favorite composer for piano would most likely be Chopin, Tchaikovsky or Bach.</p>

	<h3>Violin</h3>

	<p> I've been playing violin for 7 years and although I find it fun, I don't enjoy it as much as piano. Nonetheless, I find violin interesting though it's easier than piano since you just have to focus on coordinating your left hand with the notes and bowing.</p>
