	<p>Hugo is one of the best executed movies I've seen. It's probably one of my favorite movies because of its setting in Paris around the 1930s. It can be considered to be one of my favorite drama/ mystery movies.</p>

	<p>This is one of my favorite movies made by one of my favorite directors, Tim Burton. Although it isn't very well-known, it takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where humans no longer exist and the only living things are sentient rag dolls trying to survive. It develops characters very well and each rag doll has its own personality. It's a perfect mix of mystery and fantasy.</p>
